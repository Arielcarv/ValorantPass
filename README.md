# ValorantPass
Valorant Pass Project

***

<h3>This project was made in Python and aims at Valorant playes that wish an easy way to measure the total experience needed to finish the Act Battle Pass.</h3>
<p>The actual algorithm is updated for Act 3 that will fisish at January 12th of 2021.</p>

<hr>

<p>The principle is that the Valotant Battle Pass can be completed in due time with the sum quantity of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Daily" Rewards
  <li>"Weekly" Rewards
  <li>Spike Disputes 
  <li>Normal/Competitive Matches
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Of course this is just a <b>perspective</b>. It's a mere aproximation of what the player need to actually do to reach the completion of the Battle Pass </p>
